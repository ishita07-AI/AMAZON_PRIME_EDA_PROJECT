        "During the data wrangling phase of the Amazon Prime EDA project, I performed several key cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure the dataset was reliable and analysis-ready. Firstly, I removed all duplicate records to eliminate redundancy, which could have led to inaccurate counts of titles or distorted insights. Then, I handled missing values strategically: I filled missing director names with “Unknown”, cast details with “Not Available”, and missing countries with “Unknown”, allowing me to retain those rows without affecting categorical analysis. For titles lacking a rating, I replaced them with “Not Rated” to maintain consistency in content classification. The date_added column had several missing entries, which I handled using a forward-fill method to preserve the timeline's continuity without artificially generating incorrect dates. Additionally, missing duration values were filled with “Unknown”, and empty descriptions were replaced with “No description available”, making the dataset cleaner and better suited for textual and length-based insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "These transformations uncovered some important insights: ● A large number of entries lacked information about the director and cast, suggesting the inclusion of lesser-known or regional content. ● Many titles had no rating, raising a concern for parental controls or audience segmentation. ● Missing date_added values could have skewed release trend analysis, so filling them preserved historical accuracy. ● Duplicate records, if left unchecked, would have led to inflated counts of shows and movies. Overall, these manipulations were crucial for producing trustworthy visualizations and helped surface deeper trends regarding the nature and diversity of Amazon Prime's content library."

The dataset contains two primary content types—Movie and TV Show—and a bar chart clearly highlights how many entries exist for each.

It also offers straightforward readability, where the height of the bars directly reflects the count, and the color contrast improves visual interpretation.\n",

Hence, for an insight as fundamental as the volume distribution between content types, the bar chart provides a simple, professional, and instantly understandable visualization, ensuring the business can easily act upon the trend—such as understanding content strategy preferences or consumer focus."

        "The insight drawn from the chart is that Movies significantly outnumber TV Shows on the Amazon Prime platform. This indicates that Amazon Prime’s content strategy is heavily skewed towards offering more movies than series. Such a distribution suggests that the platform may be catering more to audiences looking for short-form or one-time viewing content rather than long-form episodic engagement. This can also reflect consumer consumption behavior or possibly a business decision to focus on acquiring or producing more film-based content over serialized shows. Understanding this imbalance helps the business evaluate whether this strategy aligns with current market demands, and if there’s a need to diversify by increasing the number of TV shows to retain binge-watchers or users preferring longer engagement."

Knowing that the platform currently has a higher number of movies than TV shows, decision-makers can evaluate whether this aligns with user engagement metrics and preferences. If data shows that users are increasingly interested in binge-worthy content like web series or episodic formats, Amazon may consider investing more in high-quality TV shows to enhance viewer retention. Conversely, if short-form content is driving subscriptions and watch time, continuing to prioritize movies could be the right strategy. In either case, this insight supports data-driven planning, content acquisition, and production investments that align with evolving customer needs, helping optimize user satisfaction and platform competitiveness.\n",

A histogram helps us see how the data is spread across different ranges or \"bins\" of values—such as whether most ratings fall in the average, high, or low end. Unlike a bar chart, which is better for categorical data, a histogram lets us assess the shape of the distribution (e.g., normal, skewed, or bimodal). The KDE line further enhances this by providing a smooth curve that represents the probability density, making patterns in the data clearer. This choice allows stakeholders to quickly understand whether the platform's content generally receives favorable reviews or not"

However, the imbalance also reveals a potential drawback. The relatively lower count of TV shows may hinder user retention, as TV series often foster long-term engagement through episodic content. This lack of variety could lead to a loss of users who prefer binge-worthy shows, putting Amazon Prime at a disadvantage against competitors with more balanced libraries.
